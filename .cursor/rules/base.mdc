# Project description

This project is a Laravel application, heavily using Livewire. It uses Tailwindcss for styling and Filament for forms and tables (but not the admin panel).

Use the available components (buttons, messages, etc) whenever possible.

## Translations

Whenever you're asked to translate something, add the translated strings to [de.json](mdc:lang/de.json), translate it using the same style as the other existing translations and replace the usage of the original string with a call to __('STRING') (use {{ __('STRING') }} when in a blade template) so that the translated string is shown to the user.

The same applies when you're asked to extract strings for translation.

Whenever you're updating a translation json file, the last line "___": "___" should be kept as the last line. This is to improve the git diff.
